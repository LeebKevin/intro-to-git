# Intro to Git
### EcoHealth Alliance Data Science Training
### June 13, 2018

---


## Goals of the session 

1. Understand why git and Github are used 

--

2. Get familiar with the 4-7 git verbs that will make up &gt;95% of your git use, and practice with the command line and the Rstudio git interface.

--

3. Know how to find help - be familiar with this doc as a reference, and be familiar with the terminology so you know what to Google when you get stuck 

--

4. Develop generous habits toward your teammates and, more importantly, toward your future self

## Why Use Git? 
- For **version control** 
    - track changes in code 
    - revert to old versions when you commit a terrible error
--
- To avoid this:

&lt;/center&gt;

---

## Why Use Github?

- To share data and code across teams 

- To track and merge changes in code from multiple collaborators on a project 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="figs/gitflow.png", width = 605, height = 370&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---

## Barriers to entry 

--
- You (and your team/supervisor) already have a versioning system already set up.
--

- You typically work on analyses by yourself. 
--

- Git co-opts regular words (fork, tree, push, commit) and assigns them *extremely* Git-specific definitions that are tremendously easy to confuse until you get the hang of it. 

---

## Getting Started: register on Github.com 

- Register for a *public* (free) account 

- Send your Github username to Noam [ross@ecohealthalliance.org](ross@ecohealthalliance.org) or Toph [allen@ecohealthalliance.org](allen@ecohealthalliance.org) so they can add you to the EHA organizational Github and give you read access to private repos

- EHA-hosted files can be PRIVATE to the organization. Any data or code that you host on your personal Github will be public. 

---

## Git terminology 

.pull-left[

- `tree`: a directory or folder of files. trees can have multiple branches.

- `branch`: a version of the tree. You can make a new branch if you want to test out changes in a file, but don’t want to alter the original.  

- `master` or `master branch`: the trunk of the tree. 
]

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="figs/gittree.png", width = 300, height 390&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
]

---

## Git terminology 

- `repo` or `repository`: a file directory hosted on Github. This should include everything you need for a project - raw data, code/scripts, intermediate files, etc. 

- `remote`: an external place that holds your tree. For us, the remote will be a path to a Github repo, e.g. [https://github.com/brooke-watson/intro-to-git](https://github.com/brooke-watson/intro-to-git)

- `origin`: The default name of the remote.

---

## Git verbs 

- `git init` initializes a git repo from the command line *inside* a folder. 

--

- Alternately, you can initialize a git repo when you start a new project in R Studio.

---

## Git verbs 

.pull-left[
### On the way down: 

- `fork`: copy someone else's remote to your remote 

- **`clone`: copy a remote onto your computer**

- `fetch`: update your clone from a remote that already exists

- **`pull`: fetch updates + check them out into your working directory** 

- `merge`: resolve conflicts between the remote and your local repository 
]

--

.pull-right[

### On the way up:

- **`add` or `stage`: get your changes ready to be saved**

- **`commit`: save a record to your repository. A commit is basically a super-save.**

- **`push`: copy that record from your repository (your local computer) to your remote (Github)**
]

---

## Git structure 

&lt;img src="figs/diagram.svg", width = 700, height = 200&gt;&lt;/img&gt;

- Remote = Github
- Repository = Git = your local record of `commit`ted saves 
- Workspace = The regular-degular-schmegular files you work on. 
- Index = Staging area where you can look at the changes you've made before you commit them. (R Studio has a nice GUI for looking at `git diff`s).

---

# Practice! 

---

## First things first: find the command line

.pull-left[
- In Mac: `cmnd` + `space`, type "terminal", hit Enter


&lt;img src="figs/terminal1.png", width = 373, height = 172, border = 1&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
]

.pull-right[
- In Windows: open the start menu and find "git bash."
]


---

## Navigate the command line to where you want it

- In terminal, your prompt will be something like `Brookes-MacBook-Air:Dropbox (EHA) Watson$`
- typing `pwd` at the command line `p`rints your `w`orking `d`irectory 
- `cd &lt;path&gt;` `c`hanges your working `d`irectory to `&lt;path&gt;`
- When you `clone` the git repository, git will download all the files in that repo into your current working directory - basically copying that folder into your home computer 

---

## Fork someone else's repo 

![](figs/fork.png)

- This makes a local copy of someone else's project so you can make changes without altering their original. 
- You may not do this often. For example, if you're working by yourself, or if you have contributor privileges to a project, you'll go straight to `cloning`. 
- Forks of private repos *stay private.*
- Fork [https://github.com/brooke-watson/intro-to-git.](https://github.com/brooke-watson/intro-to-git) now. 

---

## Clone a repo 

- Go to YOUR copy of the repo: [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/intro-to-git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/intro-to-git). 
- Click the "Clone or Download" button and copy the link. 
- Go back to your command line, and `cd` into the directory where you want this to live. 
- `git clone &lt;paste your link here&gt;`. 
- Your files are there! 
- `cd intro-to-git` to get inside the folder

---

## Check status and create a branch 

- Check your status with `git status`
    - Should see `"On Branch Master" "Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master’"`
- Create and checkout a branch to work from: 
	- `git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt;` 
	- EX: `git checkout -b myname-branch`
	- `git status`

---

## Make a change and check your status 

- Change anything you want about the directory: 
    - Using the command line 
        - e.g. `mkdir oh-boy-a-new-folder` 
        - e.g. `touch wow-what-a-new-text-file.txt` 
        
    - Or, add/edit the folder interactively, the way you normally would. 
        - e.g.: Download your favorite .gif or picture, and move it to `intro-to-git/figs`. 
        
- `git status` again to see your changes. 

---

## Make a change and check your status 

You should see something like this: 

![](figs/status.png)

&lt;br&gt;

---

## Pause because really: what a good wholesome gif.

![](figs/dwight-howard-cookie-challenge.gif)

---

## Add (stage) changes and look at the differences 

- Add file to changes that you want to “stage”: `git add &lt;filename&gt;` 
    - e.g. (`git add 'figs/dwight-howard-cookie-challenge.gif'`)
	- Sometimes you might use `git add . ` to add ALL untracked files - use with caution!! 
	- can also use `git add *.Rmd` to add all the .Rmd files, for example
	
---

## Git diff 
- `git diff —-cached` to see your changes 
- It's easier to use a GUI to do this 
- RStudio has a great one 
- [happygitwithr.com/](happygitwithr.com) is very helpful if/when you want to use Git/Github from within RSTudio 
    - Highly recommend if you are using R!! 

---

## Rstudio git diff GUI 

&lt;img src="figs/gitdiff.png", width = 700, height = 521&gt;&lt;/img&gt;

---

## Commit your changes:

- type `git commit -m "Wow, we did it, what a commit”` 
- don’t leave out the `-m`: just doing `git commit` will open a dreadful text editor that you’ll never escape.
    - Try to write a **useful** message that your collaborators (and/or Future You) might be able to understand

&lt;br&gt;

---

## Push changes to Github 
- Check your remote: `git remote -v` (if you started by cloning a repo from GitHub, your origin should already be set)
- Push your changes to the remote server: `git push &lt;remote-name&gt; &lt;your-branch&gt;` 
	- e.g. `git push origin myname-branch`
	- Check [github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/intro-to-git](github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/intro-to-git) to check that your changes are there 
	- You did it! 

---
	
## Submit a pull request (PR)

- Open the repo in GitHub and select your branch
- You should see *"compare and pull request"*. This will bring up a summary of your changes and show you what branch you are merging.
- Edit your message and click submit. Now you should see your pull request show up in the pull requests tab!
    - In a real project your PR may be discussed and reviewed. Stakeholders may suggest changes or updates and (hopefully) eventually your code will be merged!

---

# Tips 

---

## Don't accidentally make (y)our private research data public! 

.pull-left[
### Start Here 
&lt;img src="figs/new-github.png", width = 375, height = 250, border = 1&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
]

.pull-right[
### Not here
&lt;img src="figs/no-github.png", width = 375, height = 250&gt;&lt;/img&gt;

  
... when creating a new repository. 
]

---

## Tips 

- When you get stuck, do your Googles.
- If you do things in the right order, most of what you want to accomplish can be done with about 7 commands (`clone, pull, checkout, status, add, commit, push`). 
- Always `git pull` before committing and pushing.
- If you get really stuck, save your folder in a new location, delete the whole thing, and re-clone from Github.
    - This is the Github equivalent of "turning it off and turning it back on."
