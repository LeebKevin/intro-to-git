## Why Use Git? 
- For **version control** 
    - track changes in code 
    - revert to old versions when you commit a terrible error
- To avoid this:

## Why Use Github?

- To share data and code across teams 

- To track and merge changes in code from multiple collaborators on a project 

## Why People DON'T Use Git

- You (and your team) already a versioning system already set up.

- You typically work on analyses (or large chunks of analyses) by yourself. 

- Git co-opts regular words (fork, tree, push, commit) and assigns them *extremely* Git-specific definitions that are tremendously easy to confuse until you get the hang of it. 


## Getting Started: register on Github.com 

- Use your work email address (you can add a personal one later if you like) and register for a *public* (free) account 

- Send your Github username to Noam [ross@ecohealthalliance.org](ross@ecohealthalliance.org) or Toph [allen@ecohealthalliance.org](allen@ecohealthalliance.org) so they can add you to the EHA organizational Github 

- EHA-hosted files can be PRIVATE to the organization. Any data or code that you host on your personal Github.com site will be public. 

## Git terminology 
- `tree`: a directory or folder of files. trees can have multiple branches. - `branch`: a version of the tree. You can make a new branch if you want to test out changes in a file, but don’t want to alter the original. Changes can then be merged back into the master branch, so you don’t have to keep making new versions of things. 
- `master` or `master branch`: the main version of the tree. Sometimes, you can do an entire project and never leave the master branch.  

## Git terminology 
- `repo` or `repository`: a file directory hosted on Github. This should include everything you need for a project - raw data, code/scripts, intermediate files, etc. 
- `remote`: an external place that holds your tree. For us, the remote will be a path to a Github repo, e.g. [https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/china-niaid](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/china-niaid)
- `origin`: The default upstream branch. 

# Practice! 

## Practice! 

## Find the command line {.smaller .columns-2}

- In Mac: `cmnd` + `space`, type "terminal", hit Enter


<img src="figs/terminal1.png", width = 350, height = 220, border = 1></img>

<p class="forceBreak"></p>

<br>

- In Windows: open the start menu and type "cmd" or "command." Click the Command Prompt.

</center>

## Navigate the command line to where you want it wind

- In terminal, your prompt will be something like `Brookes-MacBook-Air:Dropbox (EHA) Watson$`
- typing `pwd` at the command line `p`rints your `w`orking `d`irectory 
- `cd <path>` `c`hanges your working `d`irectory to `<path>`
- When you `clone` the git repository, git will download all the files in that repo into your current working directory - basically copying that folder into your home computer 

## Fork someone else's repo 

![](figs/fork.png)

- This makes a local copy of someone else's project so you can make changes without altering their original. 
- You may not do this often. For example, if you're working by yourself, or if you have contributor privileges to a project, you'll go straight to `cloning`. 
- Forks of private repos *stay private.*
- Fork [https://github.com/brooke-watson/intro-to-git.](https://github.com/brooke-watson/intro-to-git) now. 

## Clone a repo 

- Go to YOUR copy of the repo: [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/intro-to-git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/intro-to-git). 
- Click the "Clone or Download" button and copy the link. 
- Go back to your command line, and `cd` into the directory where you want this to live. 
- `git clone <paste your link here>`. 
- Your files are there! 
- Check your status with `git status`
    - Should see `"On Branch Master" "Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master’"`

## Create a branch 

- Create and checkout a branch to work from: 
	- `git checkout -b <branch_name>` 
	- EX: `git checkout -b myname-branch`

## Make a change and check your status 

- Change anything you want about the directory: 
    - Using the command line 
        - `mkdir oh-boy-a-new-folder` 
        - `touch wow-what-a-new-text-file.txt` 
    - Or, add/edit the folder interactively, the way you normally would. 
        - e.g.: Download your favorite .gif or picture, and move it to `intro-to-git/figs`. 
- `ls` to list the files in the directory - you should see your changes 
- `git status` again to see the changes as "uncommited"

# Tips for the future 

## Don't accidentally make (y)our private research data public! {.columns-2}
